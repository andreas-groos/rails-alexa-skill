# README

Recipes (Repeat My Recipes) is a simple rails implementation of an Alexa app.

It provides a web interface to input and edit recipes.  And some endpoints for Alexa to read them back to a user in a semi-structured way.  That's it.


### A note on technology choice

This application is just a learning project.  It's using React and Rspec because the author is interested in refreshing on these technologies, which are widely adopted for unknown reasons.  Usage is not an endorsement.
